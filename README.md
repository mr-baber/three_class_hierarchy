Create a three class hierarchy that employs super and sub classes to allow objects to be created as instances of multiple classes at once.

In the App class's main method, create and print at least FIVE objects, including ONE object of EACH class, employing at least 2 non-default constructors.

Your program must include:

One superclass, to which all objects belong. Your superclass must contain:

At least 3 attributes
1 constructor
1 toString method
One subclass that extends your superclass. This subclass must contain:

At least 1 local attribute
1 default constructor that sets all local and superclass attributes to default values
1 three parameter constructor that sets all local and superclass attributes
1 toString method that includes a call to the superclass toString method
Two subclasses that extend the above subclass. These subclasses must contain:

At least 1 local attribute
1 default constructor that sets all local and superclass attributes to default values
1 four parameter constructor that sets all local and superclass attributes
1 toString method that includes a call to the superclass toString method
